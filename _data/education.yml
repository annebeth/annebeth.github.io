  dates: '2017 - 2019'
  points:
    - I joined CU Boulder as a PhD student in Computational Linguistics, with a research focus on computational morphology and typology. That is, applying Machine Learning to better understand the traits of languages. Part of this research was presented at workshops at ACL 2019.
    - Besides focusing on my own research, I worked as a Teaching Assistant, Research Assistant and Grader. I also completed 10 MA-/PhD-level courses in topics related to linguistics, Machine Learning and information visualisation.
    - After 2.5 years, I came to the conclusion that this programme was not the right track for me and I decided to graduate with an MA instead.
