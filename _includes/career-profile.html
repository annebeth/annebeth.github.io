    <p>I am a third year PhD student in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
      href="https://www.colorado.edu/linguistics/">Department of Linguistics</a> and the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
        href="https://www.colorado.edu/ics/">Institute of Cognitive Science</a>
      at the University of Colorado Boulder, working with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
        href="http://verbs.colorado.edu/~mahu0110/">Dr. Mans Hulden</a>.</p>

    <p>My research aims to answer questions about linguistic structure with computational methods.
      Those questions often come from the domains of morphology and typology. In my first qualifying paper
      I worked on modeling typological features with machine learning methods.</br>I am also interested in
      computational semantics, especially distributional semantics.</p>
